I started thinking about retirement recently: How do I get enough money to be able to "survive" my retirement?

But going a bit deeper, what would like to do when I retire?
1. Time (books, learning?) $
1. Slow travel (when retired, slow is the new normal + I prefer it even now) $$$
1. Purpose (teaching, writing) $

What are other things that are important, which I can "invest in" today:
1. Friends
1. Health
