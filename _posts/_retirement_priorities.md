I though about retirement recently and obvious question that pops to your mind is: How shall I prepare to enjoy it?

When thinking about being old and how to prepare for it obvious thing is: how do I get enough money now to "survive" being old? :) And this surely won't hurt to have good savings - this can buy you (at least up 2 certain extent) reasonable health, some fun and some external human support when things get rough healthwise.

But going a bit deeper, enjoying life after 9-5 work is over, after kids few the nest when we have a lot of time at our hands it requires a lot of active planning to get those days filled in with activities. Also important is what would I like to do when I retire? Visualizing myself in those 20-30 years, I think I would enjoy:
1. doing something that could help others (teaching, writing ...) ~~$~~
1. travel (slow way, spending at least a month in one place, to get the feeling of it) $$$
1. killing the rest of the time with books and learning $

So what are important important decisions that I can take now, to support my goals? Surely, if I don't feel well when I am older, this will harm the enjoyment. Also if I don't have ppl to share my life with, this will be pretty boring. Having enough money won't hurt.
