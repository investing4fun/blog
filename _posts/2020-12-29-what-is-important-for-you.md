Yesterday we received sad news - our spiritual father WÅ‚odzimierz Zatorski [OSB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedictines) has died.
After initial shock it became apparent that he achieved a lot in life. He had a purpose. He had grit. He was helping people.

May this New Year bring those qualities to all of you!

RIP father!
