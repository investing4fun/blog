Yesterday we received sad news - our spiritual father WÅ‚odzimierz Zatorski [OSB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedictines) has died.
After initial shock what shone through were his achievements. He has set up a [publishing house](https://tyniec.com.pl/), although he had dislexia, he published over 30 books, he helped endless people (including me) to find God. He had a purpose. He had grit.

RIP father!
