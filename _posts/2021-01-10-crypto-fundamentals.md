I was speculating with BTC last year a bit. That was a profitable time, but required daily monitoring as it is with short term trading on a high volatility instruments. It got me thinking: why I couldn't relax and treat it more like a long term investment?

**The answer is: I can't see any fundamental reason why it is growing!**

At the beginning I was kidding myself, that this is the future, that the adoption as a mechanism to store value is growing, the supply is limitted, so it must grow - basic market principles. But is it really?
Let's debunk those two "fundamentals":
- **limitted supply** Surely, Bitcoin in itself is limited in supply. There is a process to create new coins, but this is negligable. But who is preventing anyone from creating another Bitcoin? Nobody, and this is exactly what is happening - there are hundreds (if not thousands) of crypto currencies, most very simillar to bitcoin, without any real world usage other than speculation mechanism,
- **digital money**

Because of that I couldn't set myself targets (like Piotr Misiurek did), as it would be totaly arbitrary numbers, maybe only linked with the psychology of the corwds and game theory, which I don't feel strong enough to employ as a valuation tool.

You can't treat it as other 1. *fiat currency*, you can't treat it as a 2. *commodity*, you can't treat it as a 3. *traditional value store* (like gold).

ad. 1 The price of bitcoin is purely market driven, there is nobody (i.e. national central bank) to defend it as a matter of principle or national pride, there is no law to forbid trading on certain territory in other currency
ad. 2 it is surely not a commodity - it is not being used in an industrial process, not used for human consumption ... - things that have intrinsic value
ad. 3 it is becoming a value store, but it certainly doesn't have a history behind it that for example GOLD has.
