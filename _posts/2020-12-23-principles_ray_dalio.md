In [one of the books](https://finansowaforteca.pl/) I've recently read, author recommended to watch Ray Dalio's [How The Economic Machine Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0). This is an excellent piece of content that brilliantly explains economy in the layman terms. I thought that this guy is not only an expert, but also an excellent teacher. Later I've found out that he is on a missing to pass on his knowledge further and so he is writing book about economy and cycles: [Principles by Ray Dalio](https://www.principles.com/the-changing-world-order/) which is available online free of charge. He is a humble and straightforward man who built the largest hedge fund called Bridgewater.

**The [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0)** briefly explains concepts like productivity growth, economic cycles, role of the central banks and credit availability as a driver of economic expansion, all in a form of a cartoon. **The book** is based on numbers going back hundereds of years to show in detail how and why economic cycles are happening to understand that this is inevitable fact for economy.
