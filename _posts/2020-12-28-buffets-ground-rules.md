title: WIP Warren Buffet's Ground Rules by Jeremy C. Miller
---
Who haven't heared about Warren Buffet? I did, but I didn't know much about his investment style. He seems to be a very gentle but controversial figure, which in it's own is pretty rare - either he does something that annoys a lot of people, or he is a wolf in a sheep's clothing. My working theory is that he's performance is so good and consistent over the years, that many people in the industry hate him for that. Maybe this book will shed some light on him and his style of investing. Below are the major ideas that I found valuable.

### Mr. Market
Buffet's mentor [Ben Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Graham) personifies the market as this bi-polar peron - sometimes maniac, sometimes depressed, but in the long term those periods balance themselves out and intrinsic value of the stock is reflected in price.

### Owning a part in the business
Think of owning a stock as of being an owner of that business. Owning a business is not a short term endevour, so you will be less prone to market moods, but put more value in fundamentals of that business.

### Quotations - good or bad?
Ability to get a quotation for your stock is surely advatageous. But is it really? ...

### Compounding
Because of the expotential nature of the interest gains function, it really can shoot up providing we won't be eating up all the short term profits but reinvest it constantly. With compounding 2 things are crucial: time and interest rate. Even small changes in interest rate can make a huge difference, the same with extending your investments for additional years.

### It is hart to beat the Index
Buffet claims that beating the Index is pretty tough, and most investment managers regurarly fail to do this. He also cautions not to confuse profits with good performance and gives analogy of a duck: It is not duck's fault when the tide is low, neither there is a reason to quack when the tide is rising. The lesson from this is: always compare your investments in stocks vs. relevant index (benchmark).

Buffet's believe in difficulty of beating the index made him add to his will that money his wife inherits will be invested in the index fund.
