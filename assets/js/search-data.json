About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive. Example charts taken from this repo, specifically this notebook. . Example 1: DropDown . # use specific hard-wired values as the initial selected values selection = alt.selection_single( name=&#39;Select&#39;, fields=[&#39;Major_Genre&#39;, &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;], init={&#39;Major_Genre&#39;: &#39;Drama&#39;, &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;: &#39;R&#39;}, bind={&#39;Major_Genre&#39;: alt.binding_select(options=genres), &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;: alt.binding_radio(options=mpaa)} ) # scatter plot, modify opacity based on selection alt.Chart(df).mark_circle().add_selection( selection ).encode( x=&#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating:Q&#39;, y=&#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, tooltip=&#39;Title:N&#39;, opacity=alt.condition(selection, alt.value(0.75), alt.value(0.05)) ) .

            "content": "In one of the books I’ve recently read, author recommended to watch Ray Dalio’s How The Economic Machine Works. This is an excellent piece of content that brilliantly explains economy in the layman terms. I thought that this guy is not only an expert, but also an excellent teacher. Later I’ve found out that he is on a missing to pass on his knowledge further and so he is writing book about economy and cycles: Principles by Ray Dalio which is available online free of charge. He is a humble and straightforward man who built the largest hedge fund called Bridgewater. . The video briefly explains concepts like productivity growth, economic cycles, role of the central banks and credit availability as a driver of economic expansion, all in a form of a cartoon. The book is based on numbers going back hundereds of years to show in detail how and why economic cycles are happening to understand that this is inevitable fact for economy. .",

            "content": "This is the time of the year, when you tend to think of the things to improve in your life. One of the those that kept me busy this year was investing. During the COVID-19 pandemic stock market lured me in one more time. . I became interested in markets right after I turned 18. It was a time of a big boom no the polish stock exchange, and I wanted a piece of it. I didn’t know much about life not to mention how market worked so it was based rather on emotions than on knowledge. Fortunately I didn’ t loose anything, and I didn’t gain much either. This year it started in a similar way - a lot of gut feeling decisions, like buying oil at the rock bottom, buying more BTC etc. Most proved to be profitable, but still it is a gut feeling investing, based on more knowledge than before, but nevertheless emotionally driven. . This year I’ve decided to take more structured approach to investing, that takes less time on a daily basis, is more diversified and in general safer. . This will include: . find out more about different sectors (clean energy, AI/Robotics, healthcare and eldery care, biotech …), | ethical investing, | learn ways automate trading (from basics like stop loss orders, to trading algorithms that can signal certain market conditions, or even perform trades on my behalf), | research Forex, CFDs - is it something I could use to invest and in which circumstances, | figure out best ways to diversity portfolio (funds, ETFs), | how to hedge small, private portfolio, | cutting edge of investing - (like DeFi for example). | . and think of 2021 specific topics: . think about the economic cycle and where we are at now, | prepare calendar with major economic events. | . This is probably not a complete list, but my aim is to research one smallish topic a week + one bigger one a month and write it down for my own benefit. .",
